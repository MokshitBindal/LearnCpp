/*
Unsigned integers are integers that can only hold non-negative whole numbers.
If we try to store the number 280 (which requires 9 bits to represent) in a 1-byte (8-bit) unsigned integer?
overflow happens

2 - 3 is -1, but -1 canâ€™t be represented as an unsigned integer, so we get overflow and the following result:
4294967295, s avoid unsigned integers
