/*
Scientific notation is a useful shorthand for writing lengthy numbers in a concise manner
Numbers in scientific notation take the following form: significand x 10exponent.
For example, in the scientific notation 1.2 x 10⁴, 1.2 is the significand and 4 is the exponent.
Since 10⁴ evaluates to 10,000, 1.2 x 10⁴ evaluates to 12,000.

1.2 x 10⁴ would be written as 1.2e4
5e-2 is equivalent to 5 * 10⁻², which is 5 / 10², or 0.05. The mass of an electron is 9.1093837e-31 kg.
3.14 as 3.14e0  3.14159 would be written as 3.14159e0

Start with: 600.410
Slide decimal left 2 spaces: 6.00410e2
No leading zeros to trim: 6.00410e2
Don't trim trailing zeros: 6.00410e2 (6 significant digits)
