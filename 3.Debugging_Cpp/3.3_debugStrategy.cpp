/*
This approach can be generalized as:

Figure out how to reproduce the problem
Run the program and gather information to narrow down where the problem is
Repeat the prior step until you find the problem

*/

// int main()
// {
//     getNames();   // ask user to enter a bunch of names
//     sortNames();  // sort them in alphabetical order
//     printNames(); // print the sorted list of names

//     return 0;
// }
//* if names came in opposite order, we know issue is with sortnames function most likely
